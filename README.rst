About **NT**:sup:`2`
--------------------

**DISCLAIMER**

**NT**:sup:`2` was a research project that spanned 10 years. It produced more than a dozen of research papers and sprout a lot of novel ideas based on the research work of Joel Falcou, Jean-Thierry Lapresté, Pierre Estérie, Antoine Tran Tan and Ian Masliah. It is however slowly shifted to new projects:

 - If you use it for the old Boost.SIMD implementation which is soon to be deprecated, you may want to start migrating to the new version at https://github.com/NumScale/boost.simd
 - If you use it for its actual Matlab like syntax, feel free to use it and report issues.

The **Numerical Template Toolbox** (**NT**:sup:`2`) is an Open Source C++ library
aimed at simplifying the development, debugging and optimization of high-performance
computing applications by providing a **Matlab** like syntax that eases the transition
between prototype and actual application.

So What is This About?
:::::::::::::::::::::::
Did you ever want to use your multi-core machines to their fullest extent or to take
advantage of your processor's SIMD extensions but never did because of the
steep learning curve? By pushing the limits of the C++ language, **NT**:sup:`2`
uses template meta-programming to its fullest and automatizes these tasks. Reaping
the reward of parallelism has never been so easy and straightforward. Performance
of **NT**:sup:`2` code is on the par with hand-written, optimized C code while
keeping a high level of abstraction.
